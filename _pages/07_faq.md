### Q: Why should I submit to HAMLETS? What's in it for me?

A: Here are a few reasons you might want to submit to HAMLETS 2020. 
1. You get to push the frontiers of human-in-the-loop learning through your work in emerging and underexplored areas such as employing humans to seek richer forms of feedback, learning from dynamic adversarial data collection, investigating the role of humans in model interpretability, and assessing social impact of ML systems.
2. You can get a workshop publication out of it (through our NeurIPS 2020 workshop).
3. You get to build a network of interdisciplinary researchers from academia and industry to discuss major challenges, outline recent advances, and facilitate future research in the area of human-in-the-loop machine learning
