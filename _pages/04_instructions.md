The workshop's papers are non-archival. We encourage authors to submit new and original work, in the form of work in progres, or move advanced work that will benefit the discussion the workshop aims to foster. We are also accepting papers accepted in other *non-ML* conferences and/or currently under submission at non-ML conferences. We cannot accept papers that were previously, or are currently under submission in ML conferences.
